-- write a SQL query to list the titles of the five highest rated movies (in order) that Chadwick Boseman starred in, starting with the highest rated.

-- You may assume that there is only one person in the database with the name Chadwick Boseman.
SELECT title FROM movies JOIN ratings ON movies.id = ratings.movie_id WHERE movie_id IN(SELECT movie_id FROM stars JOIN people ON stars.person_id = people.id WHERE name = "Chadwick Boseman") ORDER BY rating DESC LIMIT 5;
